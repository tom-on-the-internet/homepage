title: Great Things
---

When I find great things, I put them here.

## Software

### [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

> LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim to make it easy to customize and extend your config.

This has made Neovim a pleasure to configure.

### [mycli](https://www.mycli.net/)

> MyCLI is a command line interface for MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona with auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

I haven't found a better way of working with MySQL than mycli. It's a fast, keyboard-driven TUI that allows me to get things done. I love that I can easily find my previous queries, jump in to Neovim, have syntax highlighting, etc. It makes me better, at least a little, at SQL, too.

## Podcast Episodes
