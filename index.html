                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born ~40 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Northern Ontario. It was a good place to grow
                    up. It was cold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived in West Africa, South Korea, and North York. Now
                    I live in a nice house, with my nice family, in St.
                    Catharines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a decade I was an English teacher. I
                    <strong>didn't</strong> like being an English teacher. Then
                    I taught myself software development. This was one of the
                    best choices of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think.
                    I'm interested in computers, languages, computer languages
                    and a few other things, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can speak Korean, a little bit. 한국어를 할 수 있습니까?
                </p>
                <p>These days I'm learning DevOps. </p>

                    somewhere around here.</p
