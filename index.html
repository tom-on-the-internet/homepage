                        <p>I have a small YouTube channel.</p>
                        <p>
                            I make videos about Linux, Vim, the command line,
                            bash, software development, etc. Initially I started
                            making videos to share the things I was learning as
                            a new developer. I was happy to find that enough
                            people were excited by the same things I was.</p

                            Like every other programmer, I have a blog that I
                            neglect. When I write, I write about Linux, Colemak,
                            books, podcasts, programming, technology, and me.
                        </p>

                            >I use Hugo as my blogging platform and have really
                            enjoyed it. This is the 4th iteration of my blog,
                            and let me tell you, building blogs with Hugo is so
                            fast and simple. I can't believe I used to store my
                            posts in MySQL.</p

                            For a while I got very interested in making games in
                            the terminal. This is one of them. It's a Rock Paper
                            Scissors Battle Royale. It's written in Go.
                        </p>
                        <p
                            >The game seems straightforward enough, but the
                            logic is actually a bit more complicated than I
                            thought it would be.</p

                            >I'm using BubbleTea to render the game. It's like
                            React for the terminal. The UI is straightforward
                            enough, except for the fact that some emojis take up
                            two characters and this can cause some weird issues.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born ~40 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Northern Ontario. It was a good place to grow
                    up. It was cold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived in West Africa, South Korea, and North York. Now
                    I live in a nice house, with my nice family, in St.
                    Catharines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a decade I was an English teacher. I
                    <strong>didn't</strong> like being an English teacher. Then
                    I taught myself software development. This was one of the
                    best choices of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think.
                    I'm interested in computers, languages, computer languages
                    and a few other things, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can speak Korean, a little bit. í•œêµ­ì–´ë¥¼ í•  ìˆ˜ ìžˆìŠµë‹ˆê¹Œ?
