        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born ~40 years ago.</p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Northern Ontario. It was a good place to grow up. It was
          cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've lived in West Africa, South Korea, and North York. Now I live in
          a nice house, with my nice family, in St. Catharines.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a decade I was an English teacher. I <strong>didn't</strong> like
          being an English teacher. Then I taught myself software development.
          This was one of the best choices of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think. I'm
          interested in computers, languages, computer languages and a few other
          things, too.
        </p>
        <p>I can speak Korean, a little bit. 한국어를 할 수 있습니까?</p>
